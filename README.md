# EchoWii32ESC
### OBJECTIVE
The main reason I am creating this is solely for my hobby used and wish to share the knowledge to all the hobbyist. With this own custom ESC,
we can build it with an affordable price yet having the functions we need. I will keep on improving the hardware and the firmware. The firmware
will be written in C language.
